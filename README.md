# Random Quote Machine

Made as a project for [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine)

Shows a random quote pulled from [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable)

I started this project as a simple React app - with no build tool, loading React from CDNs. But I wanted to show this React app on github pages. So I moved the basic files into a new create-react-app.
